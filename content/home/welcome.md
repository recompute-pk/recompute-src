# Primary Goals

- Enhance the quality of computing science education in Pakistan, at all levels.
- Promote scholarship in the practice of computing science education as a subject in its own right: to discuss, deliberate, investigate, document, disseminate, and practice.
- Synthesize international best practices, state-of-art,  and both immediate and future-looking considerations into a narrative contextualized specifically for Pakistan.

# Secondary Goals
- To create a community of practitioners, investigators, administrators and policy makers for sharing ideas and practices around the primary goals. 
- To provide an annotated repository of information related to the primary goals
- To generate original content in the form of multimedia, interviews, podcasts, white papers (and the like).
